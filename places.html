            <h2>Our popular places</h2>
            <p>This world has so many beautiful places that you might enjoy spending time on. Although you can't come over to the beautiful world mentioned below, but still somewhere in the multiverse, they exist. For now even if you are incapable of visitting them, you can atleast explore them from our page. Below are some of the said places.</p>

            <figcaption>Anime road</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>This is one of the most common place you'll see on websites and anime. They are similar to the road exist in the so called real-world, except the fact that they are much more popular and outstanding look that the real one.</p>

                <img src="wp1951716-anime-scenery-wallpapers.jpg" alt="A lone tree" tittle="A lone tree" width="486" height="300">
                <figcaption>A lonely girl in a lonely tree</figcaption>
            </figure>
        <p>Sometime when our mind and body are exhausted and tired of everything, we just wanted to disappear and be somewhere where we can be alone. We want to be away from all the work and responsibility, from all interaction with another human and just be alone somewhere in peace.</p>
